<h2>HTML</h2>
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/" target="_blank" title="html5"><strong>Hypertext Markup Language(HTML)</a> is the standard markup language</strong> for Web pages.
With HTML you can create your own Website. HTML is easy to learn. <u>HTML elements are the building blocks
of the HTML web page</u>. The elements consist of a pair of tags(starting and ending tags) and the textual
or graphical content inside of the tags.
<p style="margin-top:40px;">HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, <strong>images and other objects
such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page</strong>. HTML provides a means to create
structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text <u>such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links,
quotes and other items</u>.</p>

<p style="margin-top:40px;">HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.
Tags such as <strong>'img'</strong> and <strong>'input' directly introduce content into the page.
Other tags such as 'p' surround and provide information about document textand may include other tags as sub-elements.
Browsers do not display the HTMLtags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.
HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages.
Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content.</p>
